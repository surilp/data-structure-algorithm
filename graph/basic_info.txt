undirected graph - edges are undirected
directed graph - directed edges


undirected graph - degree - # of edges incoming and outgoing
total degree of all nodes = number of edges * 2


Directed graph - incoming edge or outgoing edge

indegree = number of incoming edge
outdegree = number of outgoing edge


undirected graph - path - sequence of nodes/vertex where none of the nodes are visited twice
directed graph - path
